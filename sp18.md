## **Club meetings**
Spring 2018 meetings will take place every **Thursday from 5:00PM to 6:30PM at ATC-109**. See you there!
This semester, we'll be creating a variety of C++ utility programs and web scrapers as well as working with a local startup, Acutulus Enterprises, to create a web application as a tie-in to one of their projects.

#### **Eamon Leonard**
Hey, Guys! I'm a first year English Student at DVC, looking to transfer into Berkely in a couple years. 
I am learning Computer Programming on the side as well, because I believe it is an important tool to
have. My main interests are game development and app design. [Find me on Github!](https://github.com/Klagsy)
